A ton of stuff. Here is a sampler:

* Documentation
* Lots more Tests
* Extract Preview functionality into a plugin.
* Allow route/path mounting at something besides "/outpost"
* Make authorization optional
* Add test helper modules for including into host apps (Authentication)
* Test with postgres, sqlite, etc.
* Build-in Outpost::UsersController
